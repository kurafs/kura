====

Generating gRPC code
====

In order to generate the protobuf code, you need to have the protoc compiler,
as well as the protoc plugin for go, which you can get by running:

go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go

as well as gRPC installed, which you can get by running:

go get -u google.golang.org/grpc

After you have all the required dependencies installed in your $GOBIN (remember to add $GOBIN to your path),
then you can clean all the RPC code by running `make clean_rpc` and regenerate the RPC client/server code with
`make rpc`.
